# AdaptiveCode
This is me working along the book Adaptive Code via C#: Agile coding with design patterns and SOLID principles

Notes:
* Chapter 2, 2_NewCodeSmell actually started out as more of a factory-oriented demo, but ended up with zero factories and me trying to break dependencies between assemblies by moving interfaces and implementations into standalone projects/assemblies. You can reference that solution when you want to check out how various projects get compiled and which .dll's/dependencies are output to various /bin folders across the solution.
